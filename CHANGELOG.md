- SlideWSL is now targeted at setting up the base WSL2 environment
  via a single batch file; it still includes the mounted disk
  image and has Docker installed. All else was removed: Docker
  containers, Go templates, Xfce, IntelliJ, etc.
  Those things can be much more powerful when organized and
  further developed outside of this project.
- This now installs Ubuntu 22.04 for better Docker support.
